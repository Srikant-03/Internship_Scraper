## � The Problem

You're a CS/AI student trying to land an internship for summer 2026.

So you open 17 tabs — LinkedIn, Internshala, Naukri, Unstop, some obscure university portal — spend 3 hours copy-pasting, and realize half the listings are from 2024.

**There's a better way.**

---

## � What This Does

This project is a **fully automated web scraping system** that:

- 🕷️ **Scrapes 60+ platforms simultaneously** — India AND worldwide
- 🧠 **Filters by actual AI/ML relevance** — not just "software" jobs
- 🚫 **Auto-rejects closed, expired, and past-year listings** — no 2024 garbage slipping through
- 📊 **Scores every listing from 0–100** based on your profile
- �️ **Streams everything to a beautiful dashboard** at `http://localhost:5000`
- ⏰ **Runs daily at 8 AM automatically** (set it, forget it)

You click one button. The robot does the rest.

---

## � The Dashboard

It looks like something Bloomberg would build:

- 🌍 **Region Tabs** — Everything / 🇮🇳 India / 🌐 Global / 📡 Remote — click to instantly switch
- 🔥 **Match Score Badges** — Glowing green means high AI/ML relevance. Red means meh.
- ⚡ **Live Log Terminal** — Watch the scraper work in real-time right inside the browser
- 🗑️ **Clear Database Button** — Red trash icon wipes everything so you can start 100% fresh

Cards are sorted and rendered using CSS Grid `order` properties — which means **zero flickering**, even with 300+ listings live-updating every 4 seconds. Butter smooth.

---

## ⚠️ But Wait — Some Sites Are Sneaky

LinkedIn, Naukri, and Unstop have bot blockers. So the scraper:

1. Opens these browsers **visibly** (not headless) so you can see what's happening
2. Shows you a glowing orange **"Action Required"** banner in the dashboard if a CAPTCHA appears
3. Waits **45 seconds** for you to solve it (or it auto-skips and moves on)
4. You click **Done** → banner disappears → scraper resumes silently

It's like pair-programming with a robot.

## �️ Where It Scrapes (60+ Sources)

### 🇮🇳 India
| Platform | How | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Internshala** | Playwright stealth | India's #1 internship platform |
| **Unstop** | Playwright headless=False | Scans for "closed" tags — won't waste your time |
| **Naukri.com** | Playwright headless=False | India's largest job board |
| **LinkedIn Jobs** | Playwright headless=False | 100+ search configs across Indian cities |
| **Shine / Foundit / Apna / CutShort** | Requests + BS4 | Four aggregators at once |
| **DRDO, ISRO, Govt Labs** | Requests | Real government research portals |
| **DuckDuckGo Dorks** | DDG API | Hidden `.ac.in` and `.res.in` gems |

### 🌐 International
| Platform | How | Coverage |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **LinkedIn Jobs** | Playwright | 15+ EU countries, US, Asia |
| **Remotive + WeWorkRemotely** | RSS + Playwright | Best remote AI/ML listings |

| **BigTech Careers** | Requests | Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon |
| **Niche AI Boards** | Requests | ML-specific boards you've never heard of |

### 🎓 University & Research Lab Discovery

The university scraper fires **54 live DuckDuckGo searches** every run. No hardcoded links. It dynamically discovers current positions at:

🇮🇳 `IIT, IISc, IIIT, TIFR, DRDO, ISRO`
🇩🇪 `DAAD RISE, Max Planck, TU Munich, ETH Zurich, EPFL`
🇬🇧 `Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, Imperial`
🇺🇸 `MIT, Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, Cornell, NSF REU, DOE SULI`
🌐 `OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta FAIR, NVIDIA`
🇨🇦 `Mitacs, Mila, Vector Institute, UBC`
🇸🇬 `NUS, NTU, A*STAR, AI Singapore`
🌍 `CERN, ESA, KAUST, Technion, KAIST, RIKEN AIP, CSIRO`

Every run = fresh results. Zero maintenance.

## ⚙️ How the Filtering Works (The Smart Part)

### 🔑 AI/ML Keyword Gate
Every listing must contain at least one of **50+ AI/ML terms** to even get in the door:
`machine learning` / `deep learning` / `computer vision` / `LLM` / `generative AI` / `NLP` / `transformers` / `reinforcement learning` / `AI research` and more.

And if the title says `senior`, `5+ years`, `manager`, `PhD required`, or `full-time` — **auto-rejected.** You're looking for internships, not a job for someone with a decade of experience.

### 📅 Past Year Defense
Aggregator sites often surface old 2024/2025 listings in their search results. The filter dynamically reads `datetime.now()`, computes the current target year, and then **physically scans the raw listing text** for any stale year string. If it finds `2024` or `2025` hiding in there — the card is shredded before it ever hits your screen.

### 🗓️ Summer Date NLP
- Listings must start **on or after May 20** of the upcoming summer
- But terms like `"immediately"`, `"rolling"`, `"ASAP"`, or `"flexible"` are always allowed — because a good opportunity isn't date-dependent
- Powered by `dateparser`, a real NLP date extraction library

### 💰 Stipend Check
- **India**: Minimum ₹5,000/month (or unspecified = OK)
- **International**: Any compensation is fine
- Explicit `"Unpaid"` or `0` always filtered out

## �️ How to Set It Up (Actually Simple)

**You need:** Python 3.9+ and Google Chrome. That's it.

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-ml-internship-radar.git
cd ai-ml-internship-radar/internship_scraper

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux

# 3. Install everything
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# 4. Run it
python app.py
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** → click **"Run Scraper Now"** → go make tea ☕

## 🎮 Using the Dashboard

**Buttons in the top-right corner:**

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Refresh | Reload the current data from CSV |
| 🗑️ Trash (red) | Wipe the entire database and start fresh |
| ℹ️ Info | Open the usage guide modal |

**Sidebar filters** let you drill down by:
- 🌍 Location (India / Remote / Global)
- 💵 Stipend bracket (Any / Paid / >₹10K / >₹20K / >₹50K)
- 🏛️ Org type (Company / Institution / Government)
- 🔬 Role type (Research Core / Applied Engineering)
- 📡 Source platform (per-source dropdown)

**Match Score legend:**
- 🟢 **≥80** — Dream listing. Apply immediately.
- 🟡 **60–79** — Good match. Worth a look.
- 🔴 **<60** — Peripheral. Only if you're desperate.

## 🥷 Anti-Bot Tactics

The scraper doesn't act like a robot (ironically). It uses:

- **Playwright Stealth Plugin** — patches browser fingerprints, defeats bot detection
- **Random human delays** — 1.5–4.5 second waits between clicks
- **Rotating User-Agents** — realistic Chrome UA strings on Windows/Mac
- **Random scrolling** — simulates actually reading the page
- **Visible browser for protected sites** — you intervene when needed
- **Exponential backoff retries** — fails gracefully on network blips

## � Trouble? Read This First.

**"No listings showing for Naukri / Unstop"**
→ A CAPTCHA appeared and the timer ran out. Just run the scraper again and solve it when the browser pops up. You have **45 seconds**.

**"LinkedIn is showing 0 results"**
→ LinkedIn probably showed a sign-in popup. Close it manually when the visible browser opens.

**"DuckDuckGo returned nothing"**
→ DDG rate-limits aggressive requests. Wait 5 minutes and try again. Or increase the delay in `scraper_utils.py` → `human_delay()`.

**"Port 5000 is already in use"**
→ Change the last line in `app.py` to `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`.

**"Clear button did nothing"**
→ The scraper was probably still running. Wait for it to finish first, then clear.
